    "2. _convert_far_to_cel()_ which take one float parameter representing degrees Fahrenheit and returns a float representing the same temperature in degrees Celsius using the following formula:\n",

    "The script should first prompt the user to enter a temperature in degrees Fahrenheit and then display the temperature converted to Celsius. Then prompt the user to enter a temperature in degrees Celsius and display the temperature converted to Fahrenheit. All converted temperatures should be rounded to 2 decimal places.\n",
